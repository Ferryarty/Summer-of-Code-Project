# Summer-of-Code-Project

***
For my first code, I have made an AI model based on multinomial logistic regression that train on a dataset which contains various information about many people and each one of them are already divided into 4 groups. My AI trains on this and try to label people on another dataset which contains unlabeled consumers.
